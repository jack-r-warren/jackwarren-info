I'm not an expert in this field, but I'm a student in it. I think that gives me a fresh set of eyes to look at how vulnerability disclosures affect a wide audience, and I'd like to share my thoughts.<br><br>
This post doesn't cover responsible/coordinated disclosure, but that is another important topic to give thought to.<sup><a href="#notes">1</a>, <a href="#notes">2</a></sup> This post specifically covers the writing and format of disclosures, whenever the right timing for that is.
</note>

So you've discovered a vulnerability: great! Maybe it is a big deal, the kind that warrants a [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) or a blog post or a big technical paper: even better. Before we get to that, though, we should slow down. Whatever you've discovered could affect a lot of people, and they have every right to be informed too. The key is to honestly and clearly share what you've discovered in a way that doesn't cause undue panic.

### Terms

 <dl>
  <dt>Vulnerability</dt>
  <dd>Some issue with a computer system or piece of software. Potentially allows an attacker to steal data or affect the usage of that system or software.</dd>
  <dt>CVE</dt>
  <dd>Industry shorthand for a significant vulnerability. A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) number is a unique identifier for significant security vulnerabilities; they are assigned by <a href="https://www.mitre.org/">the MITRE corporation</a>, a third party.</dd>
  <dt>Security Researcher</dt>
  <dd>A computer science professional or academic who specializes in looking for vulnerabilities and bugs. Security researchers are typically very skilled, but it is possible for even entry-level researchers to uncover issues.</dd>
</dl>

## Formats

It might be tempting to write on whatever platform you're used to and call it day. If you're in academia, that might be a technical research paper; in other cases, it might be as simple as social media posts linking to an affected company's press release. If you're willing to go the extra mile, you might be considering giving the vulnerability a catchy name, registering catchy-name-vulnerability.com, and making a website all about what you've discovered. There can be time for all of those things: this is your discovery, and you deserve the recognition for your work. What should be given some thought, though, is the timing of those different formats.

Depending on how severe the vulnerability is, it might materially affect people far outside the world of cybersecurity. The general public will want to know what is going on, and news organizations might misread your disclosure and spread misinformation. In other cases, the general public might not be affected, but companies are, and it is imperative that business executives understand enough about the issue to get behind fixing it. The format of your disclosure is one of the primary controls you have for who can and will read about the issue.

If you are partial to one that you worry might not make sense for your vulnerability, that's okay: it shouldn't be used for an initial announcement, but it is absolutely within your rights to share those other formats in the weeks or months after disclosure when the impact is better understood and there's less chance of panic.

### Technical Writing

The first question to ask yourself is if the vulnerability you've discovered affects people outside of the world of cybersecurity (even if just by perception). If this issue has a limited impact, it might be a candidate for simply needing a technical breakdown, or analysis of the actual programmatic issue. This can take the form of a full paper, it could simply be other writing posted to a blog that vulnerability listing sites can help distribute.

This works best when remediation is straightforward: the affected parties already have enough knowledge to fix the issue, the process is easy, and they don't need permission from other parties (like business executives) to do it. Those cybersecurity professionals are likely to be interested in the technical details, because it will help assure them that the impact is limited and that drastic measures don't need to be taken. In addition, this sort of disclosure can be deemed unimportant by those who don't understand it, which is fine here: it simply isn't something they need to worry about.

As an example of this sort of format, a technical paper from the recent "CacheOut" attack is below:<sup><a href="#notes">3</a></sup>

On the other end of the scale of formality, blog posts can convey much the same information. Marcus Hutchins wrote an informal but technical blog post about an existing vulnerability:<sup><a href="#notes">4</a></sup>

### Websites and Marketing

If the issue affects people outside of cybersecurity, the next question is one of scale. Essentially, you need to ask yourself the likelihood of the vulnerability entering the mainstream news cycle. Regardless, you need to make the information digestable to people outside of the field of cybersecurity. If the issue isn't need-to-know for the general public, though, this is still a reasonable undertaking that you can handle. The key here is writing about the vulnerability almost like you are writing a marketing pitch. This is the realm where catchy names, logos, and websites are all reasonable avenues.

[Meltdown and Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/) are good examples of this. There are technical materials available, but the main page of the website is quick to tell visitors that they are "most certainly" affected. Both main vulnerabilities have simple names and descriptive logos, with the more technical identifiers (like the CVE references) being obscured farther down on the page.<sup><a href="#notes">5</a></sup> These sorts of disclosures can be described as "glossy": they still need to talk about the vulnerability, but they must do so in a way that the general public could understand if they needed to. That doesn't mean there's no place for technical writing here, but it might be reasonable for it to be released later and it definitely should not be the most prominent information available.

Meltdown and Spectre's website (https://meltdownattack.com/) is embedded below as an example of this sort of format:

### Mass Media

If the vulnerability you've discovered doesn't fit well into the above categories and formats, it may be the case that the scale of what you've uncovered might be beyond what you can reasonably handle. In other words, if you've discovered something that is bound to become significant news to a huge section of the population, it might be smart to yield the floor to those who are specifically trained for public relations. Assuming the vulnerability affected products made by specific companies, those companies might have PR and legal departments that are better suited to handling a major news cycle.

This isn't to say that you don't deserve credit; to the contrary. These levels of vulnerabilities and bugs are very rare and require a lot of work to uncover, but it might be more beneficial to the general public to get information from an already trusted party (like the affected company) than from someone who is a total stranger. In this case, it might be wise to take a back seat to how the company wants to disclose the information. At a certain level of scale, your interests and an affected company's might well align: both of you want to get the issue fixed as completely as possible with as little panic as possible.

Unfortunately, there are few good examples of this sort of this level of disclosure. One of the most widely-known bugs in the history of computers is the Y2K bug, and it is now considered to have been overblown. This isn't because it wasn't a problem, but because the fixes for it could be addressed by IT professionals and the general public didn't need to become panicked over it.<sup><a href="#notes">6</a></sup>

## Rhetoric

The other primary consideration (that might be obvious but bears repeating) is that in whatever writing is undertaken, the goal is not to create panic. Even in very technical writing, it does not hurt to open with a simple, plain explanation of how people are hurt by the issue. In many cases, the answer is something to the effect of "not much," and simply repeating that fact can do a lot to help calm readers that might stumble upon your disclosure and become worried that something dire has happened.

Even in cases where the issue is severe and there is a significant impact, there is not much that the average person can do. Technically-savvy people will know how to parse what you are writing, and so in some regard you are not writing for them: you are writing for the people that you want to protect.
