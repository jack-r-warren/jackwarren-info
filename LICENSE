Copyright 2019 Jack Warren. All rights reserved.

Note:
As this code base produces my personal website, I intend to fully maintain exclusive copyright over this code base.
"This code base" refers specifically to all elements of source code, configuration, and documentation in this
repository. Of course, this explicitly excludes dependencies, whose source code, configuration, and documentation are
not contained herein.
(In other words, the code here is copyrighted by me but I make no claim to code elsewhere in other repositories)

The content rendered by this code base -- the produced website -- is also copyrighted by me, as indicated by the
copyright notice placed on each page. This means that I claim copyright over both the source form of this code base
and the product of this code base.
(For example, whether you view a blog post in source form or rendered form, I own its copyright)

This all is not to say that learning or deriving from this code base (either in source or rendered form) is discouraged.
Any fair use under applicable copyright law is more than welcomed.
(For example, copying stuff is great and can be done without attribution if the copying is limited and the use is
transformative)

Any contributions to the website are also under my exclusive copyright, which means that if someone other than me
contributes, they are abdicating their own copyright and allowing their work to be placed under my exclusive copyright.

I intend to maintain exclusive copyright so that, among other reasons:
- I may re-license the project if I chose to do so in the future
- I have exclusive and unilateral decision-making power related to commercialization
- Others can not plagiarize my work as their own
