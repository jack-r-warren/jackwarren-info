# Contributing Policy

The bottom line for people other than me (Jack Warren) contributing to this code base (my website) is that you must agree to relinquish your claim to copyright over any and all contributions you make. You must agree that your work will be placed under my exclusive copyright.

More information is available in the project's LICENSE.md file. In short, to prevent plagiarism of my site and to maintain my ability to do with my site whatever I'd like, I need to maintain copyright over it in its entirety.
