# Security Policy

The best way to report a security issue or vulnerability is via my Keybase account: [https://keybase.io/jackwarren](https://keybase.io/jackwarren)

You can access my PGP public key there to securely contact me via email. My email address is jack@jackwarren.info.

If my website is functional, you can also access the general contact page at [jackwarren.info/contact](https://jackwarren.info/contact).
